Project Proposal: Fantasy Music Tour Builder

We would like to create a web application that allows users to construct their own fantasy music tour using any number of artists and musicians they would like. A fantasy music tour consists of the following components that the user must enter information for in this order: 1. Tour Name - Daniel 2. Tour Duration - Adish a. A tour duration is the total number of days the tour will take. 3. List of tour locations and dates - Matthew a. For each tour location, there is some important information: I. Country II. State or division III. Venue name IIII. Date of touring the location: Month, Day, Year 4. List of target audiences: - Sean a. For each target audience, there are certain characteristics: I. The expected age range of the target audience II. The expected favorite music genres of the target audience 5. List of headlining artists: - Sultan a. For each headlining artist, there is a setlist: I. For each song in a setlist, just report the song name. 6. List of supporting artists: - Matthew a. For each supporting artist, there is a setlist: I. For each song in a setlist, just report the song name.

This web application will have a login system and authentication, which will allow every user to construct their own fantasy music tour. Each user can only construct one tour, but CRUD operations will be exposed to each user to allow them to add to, update, and delete from their one tour. All data will be persisted to a MongoDB database so that users can access saved information between server sessions. In addition to the main functinality of building a fantasy tour, there will also be navigation via a navbar to a music information page containing a list of links to external music websites for finding information about well-known artists across different music genres.

Users and stakeholders:

Avid music fans, tour promoters, and tour managers will find our web application useful for generating ideas for different music tours. Music fans can use our web application to come up with stacked tour lineups and share them with friends, and tour promoters/managers can use our application to come up with the foundation for a tour lineup, locations, and dates.

Technologies/frameworks we plan on using:

React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Bulma CSS
